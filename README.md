exceeds expectation attempt
This is my second attempt.  I re-programmed using only vanilla JS.
I created three Game Mode options. PvP, PvC (easy), and PvC (medium).  The PvC easy mode simply randomly selects available spaces.  The PvC medium plays defensively.  If Player One has two spaces in a row, the computer will block the "winning move".  I opted for this ove the minmax algorithm because the user still has a change to win the game.
